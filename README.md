# Nemesis
This project contains Inference graphs (updated consistently) to detect Nazi
co-opted symbolism inside of images.

Throughout the 1930's and early 1940's, the Third Reich led by Adolph Hitler stole and repurposed symbolism from pagan religions, occult sources, & mainstream religions to represent National Socialist ideas that were at odds with the source material.
Modern neo-Nazis have found a venue for the associations this stolen symbolism makes to Hitler's National Socialist party in the form of internet memes. Various sites including popular social media sites have been rightly criticized in recent years for not doing enough to curtail the abuse of their platforms as conduits for neo-Nazi propaganda. The Nemesis project aims to prove that if an amateur machine learning enthusiast can develop a program to root out violent rhetoric and symbolism on their platforms, then the owners and administrators of that platform could be doing much more than we can in this small, unfunded, unsupported project.

# Caveats:
Expect that all of these symbols will be detected with various levels of reliability.
